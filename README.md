Pedometer
=========

Lightweight pedometer app using the <b>hardware step-sensor</b> for minimal battery consumption.
This app is designed to be kept running all the time without having any impact on your battery life! It uses the hardware step detection sensor of the Nexus 5, which is already running even when not using any pedometer app. Therefore the app does not consume any additional battery drain. Unlike other pedometer apps, this app does <b>not</b> track your movement or your location so it doesn't need to turn on your GPS sensor (again: <b>no impact on your battery</b>).
